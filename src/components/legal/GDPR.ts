## What data do we collect?

We (UniCS) collect the following data:

- Personal identification information (name, profile picture, email address, social media handles — including Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook, as well as the identity of your Discord account)
- Chat messages that you have sent

## How do we collect your data?

You directly provide us with the information above; we do not receive it from any other parties. We collect and process this data when you:

- Sign up to UniCS KB (where you must enter your name and email address)
- Update your UniCS KB Profile (where you can optionally enter a profile picture and social media handles)
- Send text messages in chats
- When you link your Discord account to your UniCS KB account.

## How will we use your data?

We collect your data in order to create a safe and trusted environment for other University of Manchester students to access, and to allow you to network with other users via text and video chat, and by connecting with each other externally via other social media that you have explicitly added to your UniCS KB account.

In the event of serious incidents (e.g. abusive language, threatening behaviour) we may pass on your personal identification information to the Computer Science Student Support Office where the incident will be handled formally by staff at the University of Manchester. We may also use this information to blacklist you, temporarily or permanently, from our service if you are found to be acting as a “bad user” and violating our code of conduct.

Video chat functionality is provided by Twilio (https://www.twilio.com/). We provide no personal identification information to Twilio when you are using this feature. Additionally, this feature is peer-to-peer, meaning that the only other person with access to the data in your video and audio streams is the other UniCS KB user that you are video chatting with.

## How do we store your data?

Your data is stored securely across servers rented to UniCS by Amazon. The data is encrypted in storage, and access to the servers is password-protected.

We will store the data mentioned above for as long as you hold your account with us.

## Marketing

We will not share your information for marketing purposes with any of our sponsors — access to your data is strictly limited to the UniCS committee, and the Computer Science Student Support Office in the event of an incident.
